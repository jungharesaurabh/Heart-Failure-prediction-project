Heart_Failure_Prediction_project
  performed analysis on Dataset "heart.csv".
  performed processes before training the model that is data profiling, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
  Applied Logistic Regressor, SVC, Kneighbors, Decision tree, Adaboost and Random forest to compare between models and to obtain better accuracy.
  After the check the accuracy and log loss for all algorithms after train and test the data, and saving model.
